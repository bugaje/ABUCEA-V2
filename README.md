# ABUCEA-V2
ABUCEA Robot is an acronym of Ahmadu Bello University Computer Engineering Assistant is personal assistant robot helps students and staffs in reducing the manual efforts being put by humans in their day-to-day tasks. In this project, we develop an artificial intelligence voice-controlled personal assistant robot. The human voice commands are given to the robotic assistant using microphone. The robot can perform various task such as image classification and human emotions detection operation based on convolutional neural network on the google cloud server platform.
